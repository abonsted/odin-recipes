    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For the crust: all-purpose flour, kosher salt, unsalted butter, and water</li>
        <li>For the sauce: white sugar, salted butter, heavy whipping cream, and fine sea salt</li>
        <li>For the filling: Granny Smith apples, white sugar, all-purpose flour, lemon juice, cinnamon, kosher salt, ground cloves, and nutmeg</li>
        <li>For the topping: one egg and turbinado sugar</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: Whisk the flour and salt, then work in the butter. Stir in the water. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead until it's smooth. Divide the dough into two discs, wrap in storage wrap, and chill each half in plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Heat the sugar until it's melted and amber in color. Add the butter, then add the cream. Remove from the heat and add the salt. Let cool</li>
        <li>Make the filling: Stir the filling ingredients until well-combined. Let it sit for about 30 minutes, then pour it through a strainer into a large bowl. Thicken the liquid on the stove. Allow the liquid to cool to room temperature, then stir it into the apple mixture.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough: Turn each dough disc out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll them out into 12-inch circles.</li>
        <li>Assemble the pie: Press one of the dough halves into a pie pan. Add the filling, then top with Â½ of the caramel sauce. Place the remaining dough circle over top and crimp the edge. Brush the top with a beaten egg, sprinkle with turbinado sugar, and cut slits into the dough with a sharp knife.</li>
        <li>Bake the pie: Place the pie on a baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F until the top is light golden brown, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees and continue baking until the top is a deep golden brown. Serve with the remaining caramel sauce.</li>
    </ol>
